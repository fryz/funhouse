# üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Runhouse & AWS Lambdas

Runhouse is designed to make interacting with shared, heterogeneous
hardware and data resources feel easy and natural. That includes integration to 
serverless computing capabilities, such as AWS Lambda functions. Runhouse aims to
make users' life easier when it comes to creating, deploying and invoking Lambdas. 

This tutorial will provide examples of how to create and use AWS Lambdas with 
the help of Runhouse. The examples are using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) dataset and pretrained
model.

## Using a Hugging Face ü§ó dataset for simple preprocess function

In this example we are sending a callable function to AWS Lambda, invoke it, and
display the results on your own IDE. During runtime, the function will use some python 
libraries such as pandas, and therefore they are passed as an argument to
the aws_lambda constructor. 

The function loads the [openbookqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbookqa) dataset from hugging face, 
preprocess it, and returns the preprocessed data as a pandas Data Frame. 

## Loading and using a Hugging Face ü§ó model

In this example, we are loading from Hugging Face a [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6) 
for summarizing a text, and apply it on a given textual intput.

### How to run those examples?
Good news - the given examples are ready to be used! The only thing you need to do is to set them 
locally on your machine:

* make sure you have runhouse installed in your environment:
```
pip install runhouse
```
* Clone the funhouse project to your working directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:run-house/funhouse.git
```
* Go to aws_lambda_integration folder in the fuhouse project:
```
cd /path/to/your/working/dir/funhouse/aws_lambda_integration
```
* Make sure to add your hugging face token to the 'preproccess_function.py' example:
```
huggingface_token = "add_your_hugging_face_token_here"
```
* Execute any example you like:
```
python preproccess_function.py
python summarization_hf_to_lambda.py
```

The examples can be run from and IDE as well.
