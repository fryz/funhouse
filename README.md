Fun stuff to do with runhouse, organized into standalone scripts.

## 🏃‍♀️ Quickstart

tldr;
```commandline
pip install runhouse
# Or "runhouse[aws]", "runhouse[gcp]", "runhouse[azure]", "runhouse[all]"
sky check
# Optionally, for portability (e.g. Colab):
runhouse login
```
Or, more detailed setup [here](https://github.com/run-house/runhouse#-getting-started) and
